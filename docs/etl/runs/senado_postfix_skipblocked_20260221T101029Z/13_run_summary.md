# Senado Initiative Docs - Skip-Blocked Wide Pass (2026-02-21)

## Result
- Start: `7492/8272`
- End: `7492/8272`
- Delta: `0`

## Notes
- Wide pass without `--retry-forbidden` skipped hard-fail history (`~780` URLs) and found no fetchable tail in this window.
- Current remaining queue is dominated by legacy URLs returning persistent `HTTP 500`.
