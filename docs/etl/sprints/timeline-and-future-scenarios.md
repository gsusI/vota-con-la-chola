## Future Scenarios (Direction Options)

### Scenario A (Recommended): Rights Accountability Completion
- Direction: stay focused on `Derechos` and complete the end-to-end accountability chain quality for rows `65/66/104`.
- Next 10 sprint shape: residual vote coverage closure when a new linkage lever appears, official procedural evidence ingestion (TEAR/TEAC/contencioso/defensores) from the actionable queue, and stronger role-by-role attribution quality.
- Target outcome by sprint +10: execution/parliamentary remain `15/15`, vote coverage reaches >= `14/15` (current `13/15`), and procedural lane is no longer seed-only.
- Main risk: low-yield retries on blocked/non-standard sources.

### Scenario B: Consumer Product Expansion
- Direction: pivot effort to consumer value on `/citizen` while reusing the accountability base already built.
- Next 10 sprint shape: faster first answer, clearer comparison narratives, confidence/unknown UX improvements, and guided flows from concern to auditable decision.
- Target outcome by sprint +10: higher completion of concern->case->comparison flow and higher evidence drill-down usage.
- Main risk: UX improvements outrun data depth if accountability lane pauses too long.

### Scenario C: Sector Expansion (Agro/Vivienda/Sanidad)
- Direction: branch into new high-impact domains already listed in tracker TODO rows.
- Next 10 sprint shape: reproducible scoring methodology per domain, first top-N dossiers with accountability by fragment, and strict quality gates per lane.
- Target outcome by sprint +10: at least one domain reaches PARTIAL with auditable ranking + chain-of-responsibility output.
- Main risk: scope explosion and dilution of current momentum in `Derechos`.

### Scenario D: Access-Blocker And Public-Data Enforcement
- Direction: prioritize unblock/escalation work, blocker telemetry, and institution-facing reproducibility artifacts.
- Next 10 sprint shape: blocker incident hardening, legal/evidence packs, and watchdog surfaces tied to tracker status.
- Target outcome by sprint +10: reduced blocker dwell time and stronger external reproducibility for blocked public endpoints.
- Main risk: high dependency on upstream behavior with lower guaranteed in-repo visible progress.

## Scenario Selection Guide

- Choose `Scenario A` if the priority is defensible accountability quality and completing current rights commitments.
- Choose `Scenario B` if the priority is user adoption and decision utility in the citizen app now.
- Choose `Scenario C` if the priority is policy breadth and entering new citizen-impact domains.
- Choose `Scenario D` if the priority is institutional pressure and source accessibility recovery.

## Recommended Next Block (AI-OPS-216..AI-OPS-225)

- Primary: `Scenario A` (`70%` capacity).
- Secondary: `Scenario B` (`20%` capacity).
- Exploratory: `Scenario D` (`10%` capacity, only with new unblock lever).
- Rationale: diagnostics already isolate the vote blocker to missing upstream linkage (`AI-OPS-172`), official procedural sources are seeded (`AI-OPS-173`), strict apply is operational (`AI-OPS-174`), capture template export is standardized (`AI-OPS-175`), readiness gating prevents invalid loads (`AI-OPS-176`), strict apply cycle is default (`AI-OPS-177`), prepare filtering is reproducible (`AI-OPS-178`), `prepare -> cycle` is one lane (`AI-OPS-179`), evidence traceability is enforced (`AI-OPS-180`), raw capture maps automatically to KPI rows (`AI-OPS-181`), one-command raw cycle enforces stage-by-stage gating (`AI-OPS-182`), raw template export provides the reproducible entrypoint per source/period (`AI-OPS-183`), status enforces period-scoped KPI completeness (`AI-OPS-184`), pair-level KPI gap queueing operationalizes remediation order (`AI-OPS-185`), remediation export bridges queue-to-apply without manual reshaping (`AI-OPS-186`), targeted gap-cycle automation closes `missing_source_record` opportunities (`AI-OPS-187`), per-source raw packetization operationalizes `missing_metric` capture (`AI-OPS-188`), packet-dir cycle orchestration removes manual merge work (`AI-OPS-189`), packet-level readiness diagnostics expose exact per-source missing fields (`AI-OPS-190`), ready-subset cycle execution enables incremental loading when any source packet is complete (`AI-OPS-191`), prioritized packet-fix queueing provides deterministic remediation order per source/status (`AI-OPS-192`), the bridge lane executes `fix-queue -> ready-cycle` end-to-end without manual handoffs (`AI-OPS-193`), heartbeat/window observability tracks packet-fix backlog trend (`AI-OPS-194`), compaction preserves retention determinism with parity checks (`AI-OPS-195`), compaction-window digest gating provides a compact operational signal (`AI-OPS-196`), digest-heartbeat windowing provides temporal guardrails over that signal (`AI-OPS-197`), digest-heartbeat compaction/parity now preserves long-run signal with deterministic retention (`AI-OPS-198`), compaction-window parity over that compacted heartbeat now has a strict low-noise digest contract (`AI-OPS-199`), that compact contract now has append-only deduplicated heartbeat continuity (`AI-OPS-200`), that continuity stream now has strict last-N failure/degradation gating (`AI-OPS-201`), continuity retention+parity is now extended with deterministic compaction and strict in-window parity checks (`AI-OPS-202`), that continuity parity layer emits a compact strict digest for low-noise gating (`AI-OPS-203`), the digest layer now has append-only deduplicated heartbeat continuity (`AI-OPS-204`), that continuity stream now has strict last-N failure/degradation gating (`AI-OPS-205`), that layer now adds deterministic continuity compaction + strict in-window parity (`AI-OPS-206`), that continuity parity now emits a compact strict digest contract (`AI-OPS-207`), that contract now has append-only deduplicated heartbeat continuity (`AI-OPS-208`), and that continuity stream now has strict last-N failure/degradation gating (`AI-OPS-209`), and that continuity stream now adds deterministic compaction + strict in-window parity (`AI-OPS-210`), and that continuity compaction-window parity now emits a compact strict digest contract (`AI-OPS-211`), and that compact contract now has append-only deduplicated heartbeat continuity (`AI-OPS-212`), and that continuity stream now has strict last-N failure/degradation gating (`AI-OPS-213`), and that continuity stream now adds deterministic compaction + strict in-window parity (`AI-OPS-214`), and that continuity compaction-window parity now emits a compact strict digest contract (`AI-OPS-215`); highest leverage remains loading validated official metrics while probing vote-link unblock only with a new lever.
