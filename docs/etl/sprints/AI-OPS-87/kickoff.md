Primary objective:
- Improve explainability readability in `/citizen` with a static-first glossary/tooltips contract that is machine-checkable.

Definition of done:
- Explainability glossary + tooltip microcopy exists in `/citizen` with stable markers.
- Strict UI contract test exists for marker presence and plain-language constraints.
- Strict readability reporter + tests + `just` lanes are shipped.
- Lane is integrated into release regression and artifacts are documented under `docs/etl/sprints/AI-OPS-87/`.
