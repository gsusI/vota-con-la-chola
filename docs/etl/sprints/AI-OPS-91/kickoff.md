# AI-OPS-91 Kickoff

Date:
- 2026-02-23

Primary objective:
- Raise Tailwind+MD3 parity from baseline v1 to v2 by normalizing core primitives (`card/chip/button/tab`) across `/citizen` controls and dynamic compare views.

Definition of done:
- MD3 generated CSS includes `md3-tab` and improved button primitives.
- `/citizen` uses MD3 classes consistently in static layout and dynamic template strings.
- Tailwind MD3 contract enforces marker minimums for cards/chips/buttons/tabs.
- Tailwind test lane, release regression suite, and GH Pages build are green.
- Sprint evidence/docs are published under `docs/etl/sprints/AI-OPS-91/`.
