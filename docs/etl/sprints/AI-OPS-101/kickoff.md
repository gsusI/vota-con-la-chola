# AI-OPS-101 Kickoff

Date:
- 2026-02-23

Primary objective:
- Add trust-action nudges trend coverage so clickthrough regressions are detectable through strict, reproducible heartbeat windows.

Definition of done:
- Trust-action nudges heartbeat is reproducible and strict-checkable from the existing digest.
- Heartbeat window enforces strict thresholds for failed/degraded/contract-incomplete plus clickthrough threshold violations.
- Dedicated tests and `just` lanes are green and integrated in release regression.
- Sprint evidence/docs are published under `docs/etl/sprints/AI-OPS-101/`.
