# AI-OPS-83 Kickoff

Date:
- 2026-02-23

Primary objective:
- Land mobile observability v1 so `/citizen` latency quality is measured via reproducible percentiles instead of static markers alone.

Definition of done:
- `/citizen` emits bounded input-to-render samples for key interactions.
- A strict report exists for `p50/p90` thresholds and minimum sample count.
- `just` wrappers and tests are green.
- Sprint evidence/docs are published and linked from canonical sprint pointers.
