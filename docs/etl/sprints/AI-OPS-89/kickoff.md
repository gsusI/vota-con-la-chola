Date:
- 2026-02-23

Primary objective:
- Improve coherence auditability in `/citizen` by wiring party+topic mismatch links with URL-state context that opens reproducible drilldown traces.

Definition of done:
- Coherence link builder exists and is deterministic.
- Coherence cards expose explicit drilldown marker attributes.
- Drilldown URLs include party/topic/concern/view/bucket/source context.
- Dedicated UI contract test exists and passes.
- Just lane exists and is integrated into `citizen-release-regression-suite`.
- GH Pages build remains green with updated citizen assets.
