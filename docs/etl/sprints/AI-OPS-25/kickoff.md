# AI-OPS-25 Kickoff

Objective:
- Run a self-contained manual-labour factory with strict schemas so external workers can deliver import-ready artifacts without additional clarifications.

Canonical prompt pack:
- `docs/etl/sprints/AI-OPS-25/sprint-ai-agents.md`

Primary gate:
- All lanes A..G produce contract-valid outputs (`tasks_input.csv`, `workers_raw.csv`, `decisions_adjudicated.csv`, `qa_report.md`) with traceable ids and explicit acceptance evidence.
