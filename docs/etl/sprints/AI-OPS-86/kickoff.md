# AI-OPS-86 Kickoff

Date:
- 2026-02-23

Primary objective:
- Add explicit trust-to-action nudges in `/citizen` so users can jump to the most useful evidence click when uncertainty/trust gaps are present.

Definition of done:
- Deterministic trust-action nudge builder exists and is testable.
- `/citizen` renders nudge marker(s) and records shown/clicked events locally.
- Strict nudge KPI reporter + tests + just lanes are shipped.
- Lane is integrated into release regression and artifacts are documented under `docs/etl/sprints/AI-OPS-86/`.
