# AI-OPS-85 Kickoff

Date:
- 2026-02-23

Primary objective:
- Add concern-pack outcome telemetry v1 so `/citizen` can quantify pack adoption and weak-pack follow-through with reproducible strict checks.

Definition of done:
- `/citizen` records concern-pack outcome events locally with deterministic payload shape.
- Strict report contract exists and can fail on weak-followthrough/unknown-share regressions.
- Test/report/check lanes are available through `just` and included in release regression.
- Sprint evidence and closeout docs are published in `docs/etl/sprints/AI-OPS-85/`.
