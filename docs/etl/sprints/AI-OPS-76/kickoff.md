# AI-OPS-76 Kickoff

Date:
- 2026-02-23

Primary objective:
- Reduce mobile friction and guard performance regressions in `/citizen` with deterministic, strict, machine-checkable gates.

Scope:
- Static citizen UI and local quality tooling only.
- No backend/API dependency.

Out-of-scope:
- ETL source expansion or schema changes.
- Changes to stance computation semantics.

Definition of done:
- Mobile UI/perf improvements are visible in `ui/citizen/index.html`.
- Strict budget report exists and passes on current artifacts.
- New tests and `just` targets pass.
- Sprint evidence and closeout are published under `docs/etl/sprints/AI-OPS-76/`.
