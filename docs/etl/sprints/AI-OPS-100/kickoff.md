# AI-OPS-100 Kickoff

Date:
- 2026-02-23

Primary objective:
- Add concern-pack outcomes trend coverage so weak-pack followthrough and unknown-share regressions are detectable through strict, reproducible heartbeat windows.

Definition of done:
- Concern-pack outcomes heartbeat is reproducible and strict-checkable from the existing digest.
- Heartbeat window enforces strict thresholds for failed/degraded/contract-incomplete plus concern-pack threshold violations.
- Dedicated tests and `just` lanes are green and integrated in release regression.
- Sprint evidence/docs are published under `docs/etl/sprints/AI-OPS-100/`.
